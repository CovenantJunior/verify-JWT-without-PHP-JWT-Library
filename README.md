# verify-JWT-without-PHP-JWT-Library
See how to decode/decrypt a JWT in PHP using in-built functions and commands.


This is for test purpose and isn't recommended for production. It works using reverse hash functions to decrypt tokens. No valid signature has been used and confirmed to work.

Feel free to contribute and make suggestions or reviews.

Thanks.
